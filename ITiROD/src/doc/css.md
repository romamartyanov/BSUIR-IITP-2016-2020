# The CSS

HTML5 Boilerplate's CSS includes:

* [Normalize.css](#normalizecss)
* [Useful defaults](#useful-defaults)
* [Common helpers](#common-helpers)
* [Placeholder media queries](#media-queries)
* [Print styles](#print-styles)

This starting CSS does not rely on the presence of
[conditional class names](https://www.paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/),
[conditional style sheets](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/),
or [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/), and it is ready to use no matter what
your development preferences happen to be.


## Normalize.css

In order to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line
with modern standards, we include
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) â€” a modern, HTML5-ready
alternative to CSS resets.

As opposed to CSS resets, Normalize.css:

* targets only the styles that need normalizing
* preserves useful browser defaults rather than erasing them
* corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies
* improves usability with subtle improvements
* doesn't clutter the debugging tools
* has better documentation

For more information about Normalize.css, please refer to its [project
page](https://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), as well as this
[blog post](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/).


## main.css

Several base styles are included that build upon `Normalize.css`. These
styles:

* provide basic typography settings that improve text readability
* protect against unwanted `text-shadow` during text highlighting
* tweak the default alignment of some elements (e.g.: `img`, `video`,
  `fieldset`, `textarea`)
* style the prompt that is displayed to users using an outdated browser
* and more...

These styles are included in [main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/css/main.css). See the [main.css](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css) project [documentation](https://github.com/h5bp/main.css/blob/master/README.md#features) for a full discussion of these styles.
